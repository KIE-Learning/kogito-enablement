= Kogito: Environment Setup Lab

== What is Kogito?

image:images/logo.png[logo]

Kogito is Cloud Native Business Automation. Business Automation covers the application area of business processes, workflows, decisions, rules and optimization. Kogito brings these capabilities to the Cloud Native world by utilizing the latest innovations in the Java landscape, like [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io) and [GraalVM](https://graalvm.org), while building on battle-tested components.

The introduction of the microservices architectural style, and the rapid move to containers and cloud, has introduced new requirements for business applications. Decision and process logic form a large part of an enterprises IT landscape. The move to these new, highly distributed, application environments requires a new form of process automation and decision management. A form of business automation that utilizes concepts like microservices, reactive and event-driven applications, and serverless deployments and execution.

Kogito has been designed with this new world in mind, and provides first-class support for these different paradigms. The Kogito development model morphs to adapt itself to the type of application you are developing.

Kogito is a a Cloud Native Business Automation stack targetted at modern runtimes like [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io) and [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot). It's built on battle-tested capabilities like [Drools](https://www.drools.org), [jBPM](https://www.jbpm.org) and [OptaPlanner](https://www.optaplanner.org). Amazingly fast boot time, incredibly low RSS memory (not just heap size!) offering near instant scale up and high density memory utilization in container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.

=== Kogito ergo Cloud

Kogito is designed from ground up to run at scale on cloud infrastructure. If you think about business automation think about the cloud, as this is where your business logic lives these days. By taking advantage of the latest technologies (Quarkus, knative, etc.), you get amazingly fast boot times and instant scaling on orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.

=== Kogito ergo Domain

Kogito adapts to your business domain rather than the other way around. No more leaking abstraction of the tool into your client applications. Stay focused on what the business is about, instead of being concerned with technology behind it.

=== Kogito ergo Power
Kogito offers a powerful developer experience based on battle-tested components. Achieve instant developer efficiency by having:

* Tooling embeddable wherever you need it
* Code generation taking care of 80% of the work
* Flexibility to customize, only use what you need
* Simplified local development with live reload


=== Goals of this Lab

* Install Visual Studio Code IDE.
* Install Kogito VSCode Plugins.
* Install GraalVM
* Install cURL


=== Prerequisits



= Install Visual Studio Code IDE

= Install GraalVM

GraalVM is a Java VM and JDK based on HotSpot/OpenJDK, implemented in Java.
It supports additional programming languages and execution modes, like ahead-of-time compilation of Java applications for fast startup and low memory footprint.

Although most of the exercises in our Kogito lab can be done on OpenJDK or Oracle Hotspot, we need GraalVM when we want to compile our application into _native executable_.

Download GraalVM Community 20.1.0 from https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/[the following website] for your operating system, and follow the https://www.graalvm.org/getting-started/#install-graalvm[installation instructions] for your operating system.

= Install cURL

We use the cURL command line client in some of the exercises to send RESTful requests to our microservices.  Depending on your operating system, there are different ways of installing cURL:

* Linux: cURL is most likely part of your distribution and/or available in your Linux distribution's repository. Please install cURL using your distributions package management system.
* macOS: cURL comes installed with macOS. If you want to install the latest version of cURL, you can use https://brew.sh/[Homebrew].
* Windows: a Windows version of cURL can be downloaded https://curl.haxx.se/windows/[here].


== Congratulations!

We've setup the complete platform to run our Kogito Labs.
