== Install Kogito VSCode Plugins




== Install GraalVM

GraalVM is a Java VM and JDK based on HotSpot/OpenJDK, implemented in Java.
It supports additional programming languages and execution modes, like ahead-of-time compilation of Java applications for fast startup and low memory footprint.

Although most of the exercises in our Kogito lab can be done on OpenJDK or Oracle Hotspot, we need GraalVM when we want to compile our application into _native executable_.

Download GraalVM Community 20.1.0 from https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/[the following website] for your operating system, and follow the https://www.graalvm.org/getting-started/#install-graalvm[installation instructions] for your operating system.

== Install cURL

We use the cURL command line client in some of the exercises to send RESTful requests to our microservices.  Depending on your operating system, there are different ways of installing cURL:

* Linux: cURL is most likely part of your distribution and/or available in your Linux distribution's repository. Please install cURL using your distributions package management system.
* macOS: cURL comes installed with macOS. If you want to install the latest version of cURL, you can use https://brew.sh/[Homebrew].
* Windows: a Windows version of cURL can be downloaded https://curl.haxx.se/windows/[here].


== Congratulations!

We've setup the complete platform to run our Kogito Labs.
