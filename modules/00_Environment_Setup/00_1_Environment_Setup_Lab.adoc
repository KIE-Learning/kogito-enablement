== Install Kogito VSCode Plugins

The Kogito VSCode extension uses a new _proposed API_ for custom webview editors. This API will be officially supported by Microsoft at a later point in time.
Until then, we need to enable this _proposed API_ in our VSCode installation.

This can be done by passing the `--enable-proposed-api` flag on Visual Studio Code startup.

On both Windows, Linux and macOS, this means that you will need to start Visual Studio Code from a terminal in order to be able to pass the required startup flag.

As an example, on Windows you can open `PowerShell` and start VSCode with the following command:

```console
code --enable-proposed-api kiegroup.vscode-extension-pack-kogito-kie-editors
```

Next, download the Kogito VSIX VSCode extension file from the https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases/download/0.4.2/vscode_extension_kogito_kie_editors_0.4.2.vsix[following location], and save it on your local system.




== Install GraalVM

GraalVM is a Java VM and JDK based on HotSpot/OpenJDK, implemented in Java.
It supports additional programming languages and execution modes, like ahead-of-time compilation of Java applications for fast startup and low memory footprint.

Although most of the exercises in our Kogito lab can be done on OpenJDK or Oracle Hotspot, we need GraalVM when we want to compile our application into _native executable_.

Download GraalVM Community 20.1.0 from https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/[the following website] for your operating system, and follow the https://www.graalvm.org/getting-started/#install-graalvm[installation instructions] for your operating system.

== Install cURL

We use the cURL command line client in some of the exercises to send RESTful requests to our microservices.  Depending on your operating system, there are different ways of installing cURL:

* Linux: cURL is most likely part of your distribution and/or available in your Linux distribution's repository. Please install cURL using your distributions package management system.
* macOS: cURL comes installed with macOS. If you want to install the latest version of cURL, you can use https://brew.sh/[Homebrew].
* Windows: a Windows version of cURL can be downloaded https://curl.haxx.se/windows/[here].


== Congratulations!

We've setup the complete platform to run our Kogito Labs.
